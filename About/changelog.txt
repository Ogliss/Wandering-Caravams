---Changelog---

v2.0:
- Mod re-released

v2.1:
- Completely reworked the inventory generation system for the wandering caravans:
  - Entire base inventory generation system is now the vanilla trading caravan inventory generation system.
  - Wandering Caravans can no longer spawn with items that have a short fresh lifespan, and items that don't but can still rot have their fresh lifespans greatly reduced by a random modifier.
- Wandering caravans are now much easier to tame, which makes sense as they would have already been tamed before.

v2.2:
- Colonists now unload a wandering caravans inventory upon it being tamed.
- Added new wandering caravan related incidents:
  - Wandering caravan chased - a wandering caravan with a potentially valuable inventory is being chased down by a hostile faction; you can defend the caravan by fighting off the hunters to gain access to the caravans inventory, or you can just let them have it.
  - Wandering caravan return demand - the faction that a nearby wandering caravan belongs to has come to return what is rightfully theirs; you can let the group retrieve it, or you can kill/tame the caravan to claim its potentially valuable inventory, although the retrieving faction will not appreciate that!

v2.2.1:
- Updated to Alpha 18
- Implemented slight changes to the caravan inventory generation system.

v2.3:
- Modified the logistics behind the wandering caravans - wandering caravans no longer have their own race, which solves some mod incompatibilities.
- Any pack animal can now be a wandering caravan, not just Mufallos and Dromedarys (including modded animals).
- Wandering caravans are now spawned by an incident, which can occur on home maps or while travelling in a caravan. Also, you will now be notified whenever wandering caravans are spawned.
- Wandering caravans now spawn in a group size identical to their native animal group size.

v2.3.1:
- Added a small hotfix that was causing the wandering caravan chase incident to spawn an animal without an inventory.

v2.3.2:
- Allows wandering caravans to be generated with inventories based off of modded non-orbital trader kinds.
- Re-added the "jump to location" option for wandering caravan spawn notification letters.

v2.3.3:
- Modified the spawn range of wandering caravans that have base animals which do not spawn wildly.

v2.3.4:
- Balanced all the wandering caravan incident frequencies by slightly reducing them and adding minimum refire days, due to player reports of the incident being fired too often.

v2.3.5:
- Updated to Beta 19.

v2.4.0:
- Updated to 1.0.
- Modified the inventory generation system in order to further balance the mod; inventories are now less diverse, high market value inventories are rarer, and foods much less plentiful.
- Wandering caravans now only spawn when the maps eco system isn't full, so players can't use the caravans as a cheat to get extra meat.

v2.4.1:
- Modified the inventory generation system to make the caravans more balanced

v2.4.2:
- Updated to Rimworld v1.1
